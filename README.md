# Cybersupon Red Team Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the **Cybersupon Red Team Repository**. This repository serves as the centralized hub for our Red Team operations, focusing on offensive security practices, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing. Our mission is to identify and exploit potential weaknesses within the organization's infrastructure, allowing the Blue Team to bolster defenses against real-world attacks. By simulating adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), we aim to continuously challenge and improve our security posture.
